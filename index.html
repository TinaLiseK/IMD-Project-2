        <h3>History</h3> 
            <p>The history of both the concept and actual creation of sketchbooks goes much further back in time than one would expect, even going as far (and further) as Ancient Egyptian times, where even Pharaoh's used them. 
                While sketchbooks might not have always been bound and leathered for the artist, the concept of sketching and keeping all of one's sketches in one place was very common, especially back in times where art and artists became much more recognized in history and in growing societies.
                The first actual bound book for sketching was made in the early 1800's, by British artist James Gilray, and was called "The Paris Sketchbook." Of course, since then, there are so many different types of sketchbooks- down to the paper, binding, cover material, etc- and each civilization group seemed to have their own methods and type and paces of developing them and shaping sketchbooks to what we see today.
